# FENS-scrappers
# OBJECTIVE
<b>1</b> Use web-scrapping tools to extract job postings from FENS Job Market: https://www.fens.org/careers/job-market 

Based on webscrapping Python packages, the code is designed to receive requests and parse data related to new postings on the website. After extracting all relevant information, using Github Actions, I trigger weekly mails at a designated time. I made the resource available to public and people have signed up for receving updates on Google Groups.
